The study compares three models:
LSTM
CNN-LSTM
Hybrid CNN + Bidirectional LSTM (Proposed Model)
The proposed hybrid model significantly reduces prediction errors compared to baseline architectures.

Model Architectures
1️⃣ LSTM Model
Captures long-term dependencies in stock price data.
2️⃣ CNN-LSTM Model
Uses Conv1D for feature extraction + LSTM for sequence modeling.
3️⃣ Proposed Hybrid CNN-BiLSTM Model

Architecture:
Input → Conv1D → MaxPooling → Bidirectional LSTM → Dropout → Dense

Conclusion
The Hybrid CNN-BiLSTM model effectively captures both short-term fluctuations and long-term dependencies in stock market data, 
resulting in improved predictive performance.
This architecture demonstrates strong potential for real-world financial forecasting applications.
